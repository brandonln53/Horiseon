# Horiseon

I've cleaned up the code for the Horiseon website's homepage.
Alt's were added to the images used on the site.
The Benefits block on the right side of the page was reformatted to match the left side's height. I modified the 100% to a pixel size. I also changed the background color of this block to match the other divisions of the page. I also worked a bit with the margin and padding of this div.
I made the header links work. I wanted to make the h1 Horiseon linkable, but wasn't entirely sure how to do this embedded in the code of this area.
